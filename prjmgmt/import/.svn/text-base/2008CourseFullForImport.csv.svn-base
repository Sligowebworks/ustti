Topics addressed: Internet/IP Network Security; the role of telecom policy and how it affects, assists, or impedes Internet growth and adoption; Internet governance activities and the relationship to the technical coordination of the Internet (ICANN).<p><b>Internet Security Overview</b><p>As governments and individuals increase their reliance on the Internet to conduct mission critical activities, and as more private networks are interconnected to the Internet, a firm knowledge and implementation of Internet Security techniques has increasing importance. The increase in exposure with interconnected networks is accompanied by an increase in potential security risks presented by attacks such as viruses, spam, and denial of service, hacking and corporate espionage. To confront these risks, and to preserve the Internet as an essential tool for conducting important activity, Internet security measures are evolving and improving quickly. The course will provide a session on current forms of Internet security risk, an overview of cutting edge measures that can be taken to minimize those risks, and a discussion of areas for international cooperation on both the technical and pol-icy areas.<p><b>Internet governance activities and the relationship to the technical coordination of the Internet (ICANN)</b><p>Today, the global Internet is being built and operated by the private sector. Growth of the Internet has shifted from US dominance to a more regional structure, and traffic on the Internet is growing rapidly, particularly in Asia Pacific. More and more applications are moving to the Internet, and its role as a critical communications infrastructure is well established. Many countries are now examining what “rules” or policies should govern the Internet. However, confusion and controversy still exists over “governance” or technical coordination of the Internet. During the four year World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), governments and other stakeholders debated the role of governments and the private sector in governing the Internet, as well as how ICTs can address the digital divide.<p>Governments and policy makers are increasingly asking what the right way is to provide “rules” for the Internet and the ap-plications that the Internet delivers. Some believe that the private sector through a self-regulatory approach can best devise appropriate rules and controls; and some believe that a stronger more governmental oversight is needed, perhaps even resulting in an international agreement governing the Internet. The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) included extensive discussions on this topic. The outcome of the Summits has led to numerous initiatives where stakeholders are considering what policies should change, and whether new policies are needed. The WSIS also created the Internet Governance Forum, which is chartered for a five year period, and is meeting annually to address numerous policy topics, including Internet access, openness, diversity, cyber security, and meets annually, in the fall. An overview of its agenda and outcomes from the November 2007 IGF will be presented, along with a discussion on the IGF’s ongoing activities and potential outcomes.<p>ICANN (International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), an international private corporation supported by the broad and diverse stakeholders in the Internet, provides the technical coordination of the Internet’s key unique identifiers domain names, protocols, and IP addresses, as well as the Internet’s root servers. In 2006, the US Government announced the further evolution of its relationship to ICANN, with the Joint Partnership Agreement (JPA), which is scheduled to lapse in 2009, with the next stage in the evolution of the Internet’s unique identifiers to private sector management and coordination by ICANN.<p>The course will provide an overview of In-ternet Governance, including the activities of the Internet Governance Forum, ICANN and its functions and responsibilities, in-cluding how it works with its Government Advisory Committee and the broad base of global Internet stakeholders. Discussions will include the key policy agenda topics underway at ICANN, including the roles of the country code top level domains and generic top level domains and how each is represented within ICANN’s policy structure. An overview of the current policy issues affecting the DNS will be provided. Guest speakers from the US DoC and ICANN’s supporting organizations will join the session.<p><b>Telecom Policy and Its Impact on the Internet</b><p>Telecommunications is a key building block to the global Internet. Without a sound and widely deployed telecommuni-cations infrastructure, the Internet cannot reach all users. This segment will examine key concepts in telecom policy that can affect, assist or impede the growth and adoption of the Internet. As policy makers consider what the “right” policies are for the Internet, it is essential to consider the role of telecom policy. Today, some countries are considering applying the vertical policies developed for telecommunications or content to the Internet. This segment will discuss licensing, financial investment, and Internet charging arrangements. An open issue to many developing countries is the issue of Internet connectivity. Some countries have advanced a concept of extending telecommunications settlements to the Internet. Others have proposed that new initiatives in encouraging aggregation of traffic and inter-regional connectivity can reduce the dependency on the US as a switching hub and provider of content. A candid and current discussion on this topic will be part of the session."			05/02/2008	39573	05/05/2008	05/05/2008	"Washington"	"DC"	"M8-120; M8-121; M8-122; M8-123; M8-124; M8-125; M8-126; M8-127"

Topics addressed: Internet/IP Network Security; the role of telecom policy and how it affects, assists, or impedes Internet growth and adoption; Internet governance activities and the relationship to the technical coordination of the Internet (ICANN).<p><b>Internet Security Overview</b><p>As governments and individuals increase their reliance on the Internet to conduct mission critical activities, and as more private networks are interconnected to the Internet, a firm knowledge and implementation of Internet Security techniques has increasing importance. The increase in exposure with interconnected networks is accompanied by an increase in potential security risks presented by attacks such as viruses, spam, and denial of service, hacking and corporate espionage. To confront these risks, and to preserve the Internet as an essential tool for conducting important activity, Internet security measures are evolving and improving quickly. The course will provide a session on current forms of Internet security risk, an overview of cutting edge measures that can be taken to minimize those risks, and a discussion of areas for international cooperation on both the technical and pol-icy areas.<p><b>Internet governance activities and the relationship to the technical coordination of the Internet (ICANN)</b><p>Today, the global Internet is being built and operated by the private sector. Growth of the Internet has shifted from US dominance to a more regional structure, and traffic on the Internet is growing rapidly, particularly in Asia Pacific. More and more applications are moving to the Internet, and its role as a critical communications infrastructure is well established. Many countries are now examining what “rules” or policies should govern the Internet. However, confusion and controversy still exists over “governance” or technical coordination of the Internet. During the four year World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), govern-ments and other stakeholders debated the role of governments and the private sector in governing the Internet, as well as how ICTs can address the digital divide.<p>Governments and policy makers are in-creasingly asking what the right way is to provide “rules” for the Internet and the applications that the Internet delivers. Some believe that the private sector through a self-regulatory approach can best devise appropriate rules and controls; and some believe that a stronger more governmental oversight is needed, perhaps even resulting in an international agreement governing the Internet. The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) included extensive discussions on this topic. The outcome of the Summits has led to numerous initiatives where stakeholders are considering what policies should change, and whether new policies are needed. The WSIS also created the Internet Governance Forum, which is chartered for a five year period, and is meeting annually to address numerous policy topics, including Internet access, openness, diversity, cyber security, and meets annually, in the fall. An overview of its agenda and outcomes from the November 2007 IGF will be presented, along with a discussion on the IGF’s ongoing activities and potential outcomes.<p>ICANN (International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), an inter-national private corporation supported by the broad and diverse stakeholders in the Internet, provides the technical coordination of the Internet’s key unique identifiers – do¬main names, protocols, and IP addresses, as well as the Internet’s root servers. In 2006, the US Government announced the further evolution of its relationship to ICANN, with the Joint Partnership Agreement (JPA), which is scheduled to lapse in 2009, with the next stage in the evolution of the Internet’s unique identifiers to private sector management and coordination by ICANN.<p>The course will provide an overview of In-ternet Governance, including the activities of the Internet Governance Forum, ICANN and its functions and responsibilities, including how it works with its Government Advisory Committee and the broad base of global Internet stakeholders. Discussions will include the key policy agenda topics underway at ICANN, including the roles of the country code top level domains and generic top level domains and how each is represented within ICANN’s policy structure. An overview of the current policy issues affecting the DNS will be provided. Guest speakers from the US DoC and ICANN’s supporting organizations will join the session.<p><b>Telecom Policy and Its Impact on the Internet</b><p>Telecommunications is a key building block to the global Internet. Without a sound and widely deployed telecommuni-cations infrastructure, the Internet cannot reach all users. This segment will examine key concepts in telecom policy that can affect, assist or impede the growth and adoption of the Internet. As policy makers consider what the “right” policies are for the Internet, it is essential to consider the role of telecom policy. Today, some countries are considering applying the vertical policies developed for telecommunications or content to the Internet. This segment will discuss licensing, financial investment, and Internet charging arrangements. An open issue to many developing countries is the issue of Internet connectivity. Some countries have advanced a concept of extending telecommunications settlements to the Internet. Others have proposed that new initiatives in encouraging aggregation of traffic and inter-regional connectivity can reduce the dependency on the US as a switching hub and provider of content. A candid and current discussion on this topic will be part of the session."			08/06/2008	39667	08/07/2008	08/07/2008	"Washington"	"DC"	"M8-220; M8-221; M8-222; M8-223; M8-224; M8-225; M8-226; M8-227; M8-228"

Topics addressed: Internet/IP Network Security; the role of telecom policy and how it affects, assists, or impedes Internet growth and adoption; Internet governance activities and the relationship to the technical coordination of the Internet (ICANN).<p><b>Internet Security Overview</b><p>As governments and individuals increase their reliance on the Internet to conduct mission critical activities, and as more private networks are interconnected to the Internet, a firm knowledge and implementation of Internet Security techniques has increasing importance. The increase in exposure with interconnected networks is accompanied by an increase in potential security risks presented by attacks such as viruses, spam, and denial of service, hacking and corporate espionage. To confront these risks, and to preserve the Internet as an essential tool for conducting important activity, Internet security measures are evolving and improving quickly. The course will provide a session on current forms of Internet security risk, an overview of cutting edge measures that can be taken to minimize those risks, and a discussion of areas for international cooperation on both the technical and policy areas.<p><b>Internet governance activities and the relationship to the technical coordination of the Internet (ICANN)</b><p>Today, the global Internet is being built and operated by the private sector. Growth of the Internet has shifted from US dominance to a more regional structure, and traffic on the Internet is growing rapidly, particularly in Asia Pacific. More and more applications are moving to the Internet, and its role as a critical communications infrastructure is well established. Many countries are now examining what “rules” or policies should govern the Internet. However, confusion and controversy still exists over “governance” or technical coordination of the Internet. During the four year World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), governments and other stakeholders debated the role of governments and the private sector in governing the Internet, as well as how ICTs can address the digital divide.<p>Governments and policy makers are increasingly asking what the right way is to provide “rules” for the Internet and the applications that the Internet delivers. Some believe that the private sector through a self-regulatory approach can best devise appropriate rules and controls; and some believe that a stronger more governmental oversight is needed, perhaps even resulting in an international agreement governing the Internet. The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) included extensive discussions on this topic. The outcome of the Summits has led to numerous initiatives where stakeholders are considering what policies should change, and whether new policies are needed. The WSIS also created the Internet Governance Forum, which is chartered for a five year period, and is meeting annually to address numerous policy topics, including Internet access, openness, diversity, cyber security, and meets annually, in the fall. An overview of its agenda and outcomes from the November 2007 IGF will be presented, along with a discussion on the IGF’s ongoing activities and potential outcomes.<p>ICANN (International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), an international private corporation supported by the broad and diverse stakeholders in the Internet, provides the technical coordination of the Internet’s key unique identifiers domain names, protocols, and IP addresses, as well as the Internet’s root servers. In 2006, the US Government announced the further evolution of its relationship to ICANN, with the Joint Partnership Agreement (JPA), which is scheduled to lapse in 2009, with the next stage in the evolution of the Internet’s unique identifiers to private sector management and coordination by ICANN.<p>The course will provide an overview of In-ternet Governance, including the activities of the Internet Governance Forum, ICANN and its functions and responsibilities, including how it works with its Government Advisory Committee and the broad base of global Internet stakeholders. Discussions will include the key policy agenda topics underway at ICANN, including the roles of the country code top level domains and generic top level domains and how each is represented within ICANN’s policy structure. An overview of the current policy issues affecting the DNS will be provided. Guest speakers from the US DoC and ICANN’s supporting organizations will join the session.<p><b>Telecom Policy and Its Impact on the Internet</b><p>Telecommunications is a key building block to the global Internet. Without a sound and widely deployed telecommunications infrastructure, the Internet cannot reach all users. This segment will examine key concepts in telecom policy that can affect, assist or impede the growth and adoption of the Internet. As policy makers consider what the “right” policies are for the Internet, it is essential to consider the role of telecom policy. Today, some countries are considering applying the vertical policies developed for telecommunications or content to the Internet. This segment will discuss licensing, financial investment, and Internet charging arrangements. An open issue to many developing countries is the issue of Internet connectivity. Some countries have advanced a concept of extending telecommunications settlements to the Internet.
